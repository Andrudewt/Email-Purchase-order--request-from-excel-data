# Email-request-from-purchase-data
This peace of code generates a pretty looking email request from what procurement guys usually get from SAP or 1S when diging up purchase requests.

## _Note_:
To use your Gmail account for the script, first set up an app password in your Google account settings. Go to the App passwords, and under Select app, choose Mail, and under Select device choose Other (custom name) and fill in a name (such as “Purchase request”). Then put it in the script at my_email and password.
