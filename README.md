# Email-purchase-request
This peace of code generates a pretty looking email request from what procurement guys usually get from SAP or 1S when they dig up purchase requests.
To use your Gmail account for the script, first set up an app password in your Google account settings. Go to the App passwords, and under Select app, choose Mail, and under Select device choose Other (custom name) and fill in a name (such as “Purchase request”).
